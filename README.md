## 🎯 What is This?

**Antigravity Skills** is a curated library of **deterministic AI instruction sets** (skills) designed for Google Gemini and agentic workflows. Unlike generic prompt libraries, every skill here is:

- ✅ **Clean-room engineered** (written from scratch, no copy-paste)
- ✅ **Google-first** (optimized for Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash context windows)
- ✅ **Production-tested** (used in real commercial projects)
- ✅ **Bilingual** (English + Spanish support)

Think of it as **"npm for AI capabilities"** — modular, reusable, and battle-tested.

## 📚 Skill Catalog

### 🏗️ **Antigravity Architect** `v2.1.0` 🆕

> Senior System Architect that transforms product ideas into technical blueprints using Socratic discovery.

**What it does**:

- 🔍 **Phase 1 (Discovery)**: Researches similar products, asks critical questions, challenges assumptions
- 🏛️ **Phase 2 (Blueprint)**: Generates complete architecture (Mermaid diagrams, tech stack, schema, risk assessment)

**Best for**: Founders, CTOs, or developers starting a new project who need a technical roadmap before writing code.

**Key Features**:

- Educational multiple-choice questions (novice-friendly)
- Red Team self-critique (identifies weaknesses in proposed architecture)
- Cost breakdowns and alternative approaches

### 🛠️ **Skill Forge** (Spanish) `v1.0.0`

> Meta-skill for creating new skills that meet Antigravity standards.

**What it does**: Guides you through the process of designing, documenting, and validating a new AI skill.

**Best for**: Developers building custom capabilities for their AI agents.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuisSambrano/antigravity-skills.git
cd antigravity-skills
```

### Step 2: Use a Skill in Your Project

**Option A: Copy to your project**

```bash
# Copy a specific skill
cp -r .agent/skills/custom/antigravity-architect ./my-project/.agent/skills/

# Or copy all skills
cp -r .agent/skills/custom/* ./my-project/.agent/skills/
```

**Option B: Reference directly** (if using Antigravity agent)

```bash
# In your agent config, point to this repo
SKILLS_PATH=~/antigravity-skills/.agent/skills/custom
```

### Step 3: Invoke the Skill

Example with **Antigravity Architect**:

```
User: "I need a platform for farmers to sell to restaurants."

Architect: [Generates Discovery Report with research, questions, and objections]

User: [Answers questions]

Architect: [Generates complete Blueprint with architecture, schema, and implementation plan]
```

## 🧠 Philosophy: "Clean Room Engineering"

We don't copy-paste from the internet. Every skill is designed from first principles:

1. **Zero Hallucination**: Logic-driven, not creativity-driven
2. **Deterministic Outputs**: Same input → Same output structure
3. **Google Ecosystem**: Optimized for Gemini, GCP, and modern tooling (Vercel, Supabase)
4. **Novice-Friendly**: Educational, not intimidating (see [Question Framework](/.agent/skills/custom/antigravity-architect/QUESTION_FRAMEWORK.md))
