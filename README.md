## What This Is

This repository provides a ready-to-use `.agent/` configuration directory for AI coding assistants (Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.). It includes:

- **Rules** — Coding standards, architecture patterns, and quality gates that the AI agent enforces automatically.
- **Skills** — Domain-specific knowledge files that extend the agent's expertise (93 skills across 10 categories).
- **Workflows** — Step-by-step command scripts the agent follows for common tasks like deployment and project setup.

The goal is simple: clone once, install, and have a consistent, opinionated development environment where your AI assistant follows professional standards.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuisSambrano/antigravity-config.git
cd antigravity-config && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

The installer copies rules, skills, and workflows into your workspace's `.agent/` directory and sets up `GEMINI.md` as the global rules file.

## Skills Reference

Skills are markdown files that give the AI agent domain-specific knowledge. Each skill contains instructions, patterns, and references the agent uses when working in that domain.

### 1-core — Fundamentals (+6 skills)

Coding conventions, project structure standards, and TypeScript patterns that apply to all projects.

### 2-ai — AI & Agents (21 skills)

Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph, CrewAI), RAG systems, prompt engineering, voice AI development, and agent evaluation frameworks.

### 3-web — Web Development (17 skills)

Next.js App Router patterns, React best practices, Tailwind CSS architecture, Supabase integration, Vercel deployment, and UI/UX design principles.

### 4-automation — Testing & DevOps (10 skills)

Playwright browser testing, GitHub Actions workflows, deployment procedures, and web scraping with Firecrawl.

### 5-security — Security (5 skills)

API security best practices and penetration testing checklists.

### 6-content — Content Creation

Technical writing guidelines, SEO copywriting, and documentation standards.

### 7-meta — Skill Management (3 skills)

Tools for creating new skills, planning with files, and continuous improvement (Kaizen).

### 8-blockchain — Celo & EVM (19 skills)

Full Celo development stack: MiniPay integration, fee abstraction, stablecoin addresses, Celo Composer scaffolding, viem/wagmi libraries, Hardhat/Foundry tooling, cross-chain bridging, DeFi protocol integration, ERC-8004 agent trust protocol, and x402 HTTP payment protocol.

## Rules Overview

The rules define how the AI agent writes and validates code. They are loaded into the agent's context and enforced automatically.

| Rule                        | Purpose                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PROTOCOL_ZERO.md`          | Core philosophy: quality over speed, local as source of truth     |
| `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARDS.md` | Project structure, component organization, file naming            |
| `CODE_STANDARDS.md`         | TypeScript strict mode, import order, error handling, JSDoc       |
| `QUALITY_GATES.md`          | Pre-commit checks, build verification, accessibility, performance |

---

## Customization

`GEMINI.md` is the main configuration file. It aggregates all rules into a single document that the AI agent reads. Edit it to:

- Add or remove rules
- Change naming conventions
- Adjust quality thresholds
- Add workflow routing for your own commands

Sections marked with `<!-- CUSTOMIZE -->` are designed to be modified.
